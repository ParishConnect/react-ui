Two things that Jesus did at the Last Supper stand out as not being correct, starting with what happened at the meal itself. It was a Passover meal, but it became way more than that. For at that meal, Jesus took some bread and some wine, He blessed them and then said, this is my body, this is my blood. Take and eat my body, take and drink my blood, and do this again and again in memory of me. What? That bread, that wine is now His body and blood? That’s not just incorrect, in fact, that’s crazy. But Jesus shakes His head and says, “No, it’s right, it’s true”. And we believe it. So we keep on doing it again and again in every mass.",

When you’re the big shot, people should be catering to you. With great responsibility should come some nice perks. But to that Jesus said, “Wrong answer.” For He reminds them that to be a follower of His – even if you are a Pope or a Bishop or a Priest or in any position of leadership – your role is to serve others – no matter what, no matter who.",

That the long- expected Messiah, the Son of God, would be subjected to a death – and not just any death, but one that was so horrible. Not only that, Jesus said he needed to do so! Throughout the gospels He frequently said that had to give his life as a ransom for many, to save us from our sins. What? It’s no surprise what St. Paul said that in his 1st letter to the Corinthians that to most of the Greeks and Jews he encountered, Jesus’ death on the cross was not only incorrect, but sheer foolishness.",

Because of what Jesus did, there is now the possibility of eternal life - with God, with our family members and friends, with the saints, with all people of all time – together – forever! No wonder St. Paul provocatively taunted death with his famous line in 1 Corinthians 15:15, “O death where is your victory, O death where is your sting?” For we who believe, the reality of our death is no longer scary – for we believe life changes, it does not end, when we die.",

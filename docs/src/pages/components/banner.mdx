## Introduction

The `Banner` component composes a `Pane` to handle static actions.

## Banner

```jsx
<Pane>
  <Banner subtitle="Subtitle goes here">Title goes here</Banner>
</Pane>
```

## Banner with action

```jsx
<Pane>
  <Banner
    action={{
      icon: 'trash',
      onClick: () => toaster.danger('deleted')
    }}
    subtitle="Click the button"
  >
    With an action & icon
  </Banner>
</Pane>
```

## Banner with long title

Titles/subtitles are clipped at 350px while banners are clipped at 500px

```jsx
<Pane>
  <Banner subtitle="This is a very long subtitle, even though it is small, it goes on for longer than it's allowed">
    This is a very long title it goes on for longer than it's allowed
  </Banner>
</Pane>
```

<PropsTable of="Banner" />
